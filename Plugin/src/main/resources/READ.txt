Before modifying configuration for blocks make note of the following
- If the section asks for a "particle", use values from https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Particle.html
- If the section asks for a "material", use values from https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
- If the section asks for an "entityType", use values from https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
- If the section asks for a "type" in a "blockParticleEffect", use values from https://github.com/steveyxz/SimpleLuckyBlocks/blob/master/Plugin/src/main/java/me/partlysunny/particle/EffectType.java
- If the section asks for a "id" in an "enchantments" section, use values from https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html

INVALID VALUES WILL MOST LIKELY CAUSE FATAL ERRORS
If a valid value is not working contact the developer :)
